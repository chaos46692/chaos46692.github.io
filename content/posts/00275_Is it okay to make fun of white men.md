Noted anti-racist writer (and decidedly white white-guy) Tim Wise has an excellent piece about the myth of "reverse racism", and I encourage you to[ read the whole thing](http://www.timwise.org/2002/06/honky-wanna-cracker-examining-the-myth-of-reverse-racism/). My favorite paragraph, though, is this one:

> I don't care about reverse racism, jokes at the expense of the straight, the male, and the able-bodied because right now, in our world it has no power. None. It might make some guy feel bad for a minute, but it doesn't contribute to a vile systemic problem the same way that attacks and slurs against women and minorities do. It simply doesn't.

Does making fun of anyone, ever, make you a great person? No. (And I don't claim to be a great person. Comedy often hurts someone's feelings.) But making fun of men, white people, able-bodied people, straight people, etc is simply not the same as someone from those groups making fun of a minority. It really isn't.
