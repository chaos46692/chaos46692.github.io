From the start there has been a lot of internal and external discussion of whether or not a project like More Than Men with it's country-club style membership can really serve a purpose in the movement for greater equality and diversity. Obviously I think it can, if only because there are some people who are receptive to the message but because of how society trains them they have a harder time hearing and understanding a minority voice. But straight, white, cis, able-bodied men can't be all there is anywhere. Now that we've got almost two months behind us here it's time to get closer to where I've wanted us to be all along.

Consider this the official announcement of and your invitation to contribute to "__What I Wish You Knew About Me__". If you're not the "default" in one of our [cultural categories](http://www.morethanmen.org/2012/02/15/lets-go-deeper-on-privilege-for-a-minute/), here's where we need you. We need to you give us the perspective we're missing. We want to give you the mic for a minute and tell us about something that most people miss about what life is like for you that you _really _want us to know about. Or respond to something someone here has written and tell us what we got wrong or overlooked. We want to learn from you so that we can be less jerky. Please give us a hand?
