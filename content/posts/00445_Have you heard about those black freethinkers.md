Well, the truth is there is a long history of secularism and humanism in the African-American community and it's long past time that the rest of us took notice. There's also a way we can help the growing numbers of atheists and free-thinkers of color. It's call the [Day of Solidarity for Black Non-Believers](http://aahumanism.net/announcements/view/day_of_solidarity_for_black_non_believers) and I encourage you to help spread the word.

That last link was to a brand new site, [African-Americans for Humanism](http://aahumanism.net/), and it's one I'm really excited about. I salute [Debbie Goddard](http://aahumanism.net/stories/view/debbie_goddard) and thank her for her work on this project. I'm a white dude, but I know how important this is and hope to see her soon overwhelmed with work as this project takes off. I will also be looking at ways I can help the cause.

But, you ask, what can AAH do for me? Well, they have a growing [directory of local groups](http://aahumanism.net/groups) for black non-believers, information on [important black humanists](http://aahumanism.net/history) in history, and my personal favorite (!!!) a [speaker bureau](http://aahumanism.net/speakers) so we can make the our conferences and panels less monochrome!

Oh yeah, and they're starting a [multimedia awareness](http://aahumanism.net/announcements/view/announcing_the_we_are_aah_campaign) campaign. Seriously amazing, folks.

Okay folks, if you are a free-thinker of color, I hope you already new about AAH. If not, I'm glad I could do a small part to further their mission. If you're not African-American, please help spread the word about [AAH ](http://aahumanism.net/)and the [Day of Solidarity for Black Non-Believers](http://aahumanism.net/announcements/view/day_of_solidarity_for_black_non_believers)
