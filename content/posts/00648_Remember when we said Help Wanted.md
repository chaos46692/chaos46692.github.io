Don't worry about having something "original" to say (lord knows I'm not very original), or for it being super-duper polished (you've read my work, right), just write a few hundred words, make a video, draw a picture...and [send it to me](mailto:sasha@womenthinkingfree.org)! Tell us that diversity is important to you. Tell us what you're doing to make things better.

Also, still looking for a couple of staff writers who can post once or twice a week. I am a busy guy and I need help to make this place as awesome as it can be. [Get in touch](mailto:sasha@womenthinkingfree.org), please.

( If you really won't contribute, please at least spread this call far and wide to people who might.)
