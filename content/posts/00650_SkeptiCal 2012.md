Not only will I be attending (though not speaking), but we've managed to get an even split between male and female [speakers ](http://www.skepticalcon.org/speakers)including our parent organization's president, [Elyse Anders](http://twitter.com/#!/dELYSEious) of the Women Thinking Free Foundation.

Tickets until April 1st are \$50 (\$35 for students) and \$60 for everyone thereafter so, [get your tickets soon](http://www.skepticalcon.org/tickets) and save yourself some money for the bar!
