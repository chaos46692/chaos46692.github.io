- [FOGcon is a feminist-friendly literary science fiction convention](http://aqueductpress.blogspot.com/2012/01/fogcon-literary-feminist-friendly.html). And it's happening in my back yard at the end of March. Feminist nerds, unite!
- [The Good Men Project shared our critique of them with their readers](http://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/patriarchy-messes-with-all-of-us/). The commentors there when nuts. Sasha is now a [hipster lady](http://www.pixlee.net/?p=55). And now you can share your awesomely stupid anti-diversity comments on a [Tumblr](http://lookhipsterlady.tumblr.com/)!
- [Shuffling feet: a black man’s view on Schroedinger’s Rapist](http://freethoughtblogs.com/crommunist/2012/01/16/shuffling-feet-a-black-mans-view-on-schroedingers-rapist/). A dismantling of a common "argument" used by the anti-diversity side, written by someone who knows.
- [Obama guaranteed near-universal contraceptive coverage](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/01/20/407994/obama-administration-approves-rule-that-guarantees-near-universal-contraceptive-coverage/?mobile=nc).

- [The fine folks at SPARK have a great letter to the people at LEGO](http://www.sparksummit.com/2012/01/20/our-letter-to-lego/) about what's wrong with the problems they (and we) see with LEGO marketing. I encourage you to go [sign their petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/tell-lego-to-stop-selling-out-girls-liberatelegos), before or after you hear [Bailey Shoemaker Richards](http://twitter.com/#!/the_author_) talk to [NPR about the issue](http://www.npr.org/2012/01/18/145397007/gender-controversy-stacks-up-against-lego-friends).
- & [A young woman in Costa Rica is improving science education and outreach for her fellow high school students](http://www.spacetweepsociety.org/2012/01/20/pictor-project-2012/). She needs helps finding speakers for her second year doing so. Are you a space scientist or do you know one? Here's your chance to promote diversity for realsies.
