![Even this dude thinks diversity is awesome](http://www.morethanmen.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/thumbsUp1-150x150.jpg)

It's come to our attention that there are some people who are a little confused by what the More Than Men project is all about. Perhaps because our original [About](http://www.morethanmen.org/about/) was not as clear as it should have been, perhaps because a group of white guys gathering together for something that's not horrible is such a novel concept, but somehow there are people who either have the wrong idea about us or who are skeptical about what we will actually be doing. So let me break it down.

- We're a group of men (at present straight, white, and able-bodied men) who want the world to be a better place.
- We believe that the world will be a better place when everyone can participate regardless of their gender identity, race, sexual orientation, or ability.
- We recognize that we have social privilege that makes it easier for us to ignore or not notice injustices in the world and that people who have different experiences in the world almost always know more about what their life is like than we do.
- We want to learn how to be better, more empathic people and we want to learn how to include everyone in our communities.
- We want to talk to other men so that they can see the benefit in joining us, so that they can value diversity, and so that they can have the tools to make a difference in their world.

Here are a few things we aren't:
- We are not aiming to "mansplain" what sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia, or ableism are _really_ all about to victims of those things.
- While all of us have friends in our communities, we are not dedicated to being a faction for any particular clique, faction, or person.
- We are not jerks.

Hopefully that makes things a little more clear, and hopefully it's inspired you to follow along and join us. It's nice to be on the right side of history.
