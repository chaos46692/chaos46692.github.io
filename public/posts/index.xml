      <title>00701_We Need to Talk Defaulting and Bias</title>

      <description>Something that Natalie Reed touched on, is the fact that straight, white, cis men are seen as the “default“. This cultural message leads some male skeptics, who should really know better, to have internalized an idea that minorities have biases (because, obviously, they’re different!) and they do not. I think this is the biggest factor leading to what’s come to be called “mansplaining“. (When you think about it, “mansplaining” is not much different from what many skeptics and atheists do all the time when talk to theists, climate change deniers, creationists, anti-vaxers, etc.</description>

      <title>Natalie Reed Thoughts From A Diversity Hire</title>

      <description>[I asked Natalie Reed if I could publish this here because she makes a point I have been failing to make, and she makes it much better than I could have. It originally appeared on February 20, 2012. And yes, she&amp;rsquo;s our first non-white dude contributor, but we&amp;rsquo;re looking for more.]
This post is not going to be another discussion of Loftus or his remarks. There’s not really any need to carry that any further, I feel comfortable with how this resolved and like there isn’t much left to be said.</description>

      <description>I despair and come close to just saying &amp;ldquo;fuck it&amp;rdquo; and abandoning my participation in the skeptic and atheist communities on at least a weekly basis because of how often I see unconscionable behavior not only happen but being defended by man, and in some cases at least tolerated by very prominent leaders in our community. Sam Harris has famously argued that &amp;ldquo;moderate&amp;rdquo;, liberal theists provide cover for religious extremists. I see the same thing happening here.</description>

      <description>From the start there has been a lot of internal and external discussion of whether or not a project like More Than Men with it&amp;rsquo;s country-club style membership can really serve a purpose in the movement for greater equality and diversity. Obviously I think it can, if only because there are some people who are receptive to the message but because of how society trains them they have a harder time hearing and understanding a minority voice.</description>

      <description>That’s just not true. I’m going to admit something right now. I’m a straight, white guy with a middle-class upbringing. I am also, irrevocably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and probably a host of other -ists and -phobics that you can toss at me. I’m like this because I’m a product of a society that is also racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and all the others. I’ve been taught a certain view of normalcy, and as a result, I act with mannerisms that reflect this certain view.</description>

      <description>Something lighter today. My good friend and my favorite comedian Matt Gubser gives his take on the questions I asked on Friday. This is him working on his bit before it&amp;rsquo;s completely finished, so he&amp;rsquo;s asked that you not judge him by it. I think it&amp;rsquo;s hilarious, though.(Video is NSFW due to some salty language.)</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t worry about having something &amp;ldquo;original&amp;rdquo; to say (lord knows I&amp;rsquo;m not very original), or for it being super-duper polished (you&amp;rsquo;ve read my work, right), just write a few hundred words, make a video, draw a picture&amp;hellip;and send it to me! Tell us that diversity is important to you. Tell us what you&amp;rsquo;re doing to make things better.
Also, still looking for a couple of staff writers who can post once or twice a week.</description>

      <description>Bullshit.
First off, we all have stories about that atheist who is not a critical thinker. My own is a guy who laughed at Christianity because their sole evidence was a book that is a few thousand years old. In the next breath he sang the praises of traditional Chinese magical ground-up penisherbal medicine, because it&amp;rsquo;s been practiced for thousands of years. In other words what was laughable as evidence for Christianity was compelling evidence for something that appealed to him.</description>

      <description>Is there a difference, as some have told me there is, between saying a woman &amp;ldquo;dresses like a slut&amp;rdquo; and calling her a slut?
Is there a difference between calling a man a whore and calling a woman a whore? Please explain why you think so.
Are women responsible for the sexual behavior of men around them if they dress a certain way? Where does that line get drawn? What does that say about men and their agency as humans?</description>

      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s the thing: unless you start being an asshole I&amp;rsquo;m not trying to make you feel like a crappy person. We&amp;rsquo;re all forced into this system and we have to reason our way out of it. Just like many of us reject the &amp;ldquo;common sense&amp;rdquo; arguments for religious belief and then we ask questions and gather information and draw a conclusion. Your average theist isn&amp;rsquo;t stupid or evil, they just haven&amp;rsquo;t done the work or had that &amp;ldquo;deconversion&amp;rdquo; moment.</description>

 The most insidious form of douchebag is the Misunderstood Douchebag. You know the type: he&amp;rsquo;s really not that bad, people just don&amp;rsquo;t understand his ways. If only people got that what he was doing was noble and not at all in the blind pursuit of getting into girls&#39; pants, the world would be a much fairer place. The Misunderstood Douchebag is the genus of the species Nice GuyTM.</description>

      <description>A reader hipped me to a video recently. I watched it. I can see the appeal, since it&amp;rsquo;s a video all about being awesomer to people. Something about it didn&amp;rsquo;t sit right with me, though. Here, you watch and then we&amp;rsquo;ll get back together after the jump and compare notes.
  Okay, so, yes, it&amp;rsquo;s not nice to call people homophobic names. It also doesn&amp;rsquo;t make you more straight to do so.</description>

“Feminist” is a polarizing word. You’ll generally see it used in one of two ways: as self-identification by people who consider themselves feminists, and as a pejorative by people who do not.
It’s a word with an ugly connotation in many people’s minds, not unlike the word “atheist”; people hear the “-ist” suffix and infer an ideology that seeks feminine supremacy rather than gender equality, just as many see atheism as a rebellious denial of God rather than an affirmative acceptance of a godless universe.</description>

      <description>In the last day much has been&amp;amp; said about &amp;ldquo;The Amazing Atheist&amp;rdquo;, most notably (from my chair) by Jen McCreight, Greg Laden, and PZ Myers. Until this morning I didn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;amp; intend to address it in this space until reading the comment&amp;rsquo;s on PZ&amp;rsquo;s piece filled me with such a dark, bleak sense of despair about the state of humanity and the atheist/skeptical community. So, I&amp;rsquo;d like to start out by stating, very clearly, exactly how I feel about this &amp;ldquo;Amazing&amp;rdquo; guy and his defenders.</description>

      <description>Like many within the skeptical community, I have been reading with interest the recent discussion which has been waged (or, should I say, raged?) on the topic of diversity within the skeptical movement.&amp;amp; Apparently, it all goes back to this article – Why White Men Should Refuse to be on Panels of All White Men – which led to this blog post over at Skepchick.&amp;amp; It also seems that there is a bit of a “storm” of controversy swirling as a result of the discussion generated by these articles.</description>

Please send me a message (sasha AT womenthinkingfree DOT org) with a little bit about yourself, a couple samples of your writing, and a drive to promote diversity in our communities. (You will have a salary of imaginary bacon, which is how we pay people around here. Yes, it&amp;rsquo;s vegan.)

      <description>Well, the truth is there is a long history of secularism and humanism in the African-American community and it&amp;rsquo;s long past time that the rest of us took notice. There&amp;rsquo;s also a way we can help the growing numbers of atheists and free-thinkers of color. It&amp;rsquo;s call the Day of Solidarity for Black Non-Believers and I encourage you to help spread the word.
That last link was to a brand new site, African-Americans for Humanism, and it&amp;rsquo;s one I&amp;rsquo;m really excited about.</description>

      <description>A lot of guys, and all Nice Guys™, like to talk about the Friendzone, which is a desolate wasteland of no-sex that men are cast into by callous women who don&amp;rsquo;t want to fuck them. It works like this: Dude likes a lady. I mean he REALLY likes her. She likes him, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t LIKE like him. He is banished to the Friendzone and his penis is dry forever after.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Just read your guide to not being a misogynist. I&amp;rsquo;m very interested in your views on privilege from here in England. It&amp;rsquo;s interesting to see how hot you are at proclaiming white, male, heterosexual males to be privileged.
&amp;ldquo;I agree to a certain extent, but domestically I feel that class, socio-economic, health and educational attainment are just as important. Therefore, in your mind I&amp;rsquo;m possibly one of those males who you may consider &amp;lsquo;just don&amp;rsquo;t get it&amp;rsquo;.</description>

      <description>As we all know, the condition of one&amp;rsquo;s body has little bearing on their mind and what they can contribute to our communities. As someone who helps organize a skeptical conference in Northern California I found myself thinking how event organizers can take some extra steps to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t miss out on hearing any worthy voices in our cause. I asked for some input from skeptics and atheists with disabilities and have a few ideas myself.</description>

      <description>[NOTE: This was originally published in July 2011.]
First, some background It seems the whole thing got started when Rebecca Watson of Skepchick wrote about an encounter she had with a man in an elevator in Dublin.&amp;amp; Long story short: the guy propositioned her, and she said no; she also felt somewhat cornered seeing as how she was stuck, alone, in a metal cage with the guy.&amp;amp; Apparently, there were a number of people who thought she handled the situation poorly (especially by blogging about it and noting the inappropriate behavior on the part of the man in question).</description>

      <description>By now, everybody in the atheosphere is familiar with the Jessica Ahlquist story, and especially the latest development&amp;amp; in the saga. The sheer amount of bigotry, hatred, and blind, unthinking idiocy on display by citizens of Cranston is astonishing, made no less so by their calls for religious tolerance.
&amp;hellip;wait for it&amp;hellip;.
&amp;ldquo;Religious tolerance?!&amp;rdquo;
(missing image)  That&amp;rsquo;s right, kids. We&amp;rsquo;re being the intolerant ones. Most of you are familiar with this trick where no distinction is made between &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;private,&amp;rdquo; and where reality is blown so far out of proportion that if I didn&amp;rsquo;t know the facts of the case, I&amp;rsquo;d be outraged, too.</description>

      <description>[A slightly different version of this piece was posted on Sasha&amp;rsquo;s personal site. It is being reposted for this new audience.]
 Women are nice to look at. They’re quite often pretty, they have an appealing shape, and our sexuality drives us to want to copulate with them. Women who are intelligent and/or who agree with our world view are even nicer to look at. I don’t know a single person in our communities who doesn’t say they are more attracted to other members of our community than they are to people with different views on science, rationalism, and religion.</description>

      <description>[This article was originally posted on the author&amp;rsquo;s blog.]
 &amp;ldquo;A three-judge federal appeals panel ruled Friday that the state of Texas can move ahead with enforcement of a law requiring doctors to provide a sonogram to pregnant women before they get an abortion.&amp;quot;
&amp;ldquo;As written, the law would require women seeking an abortion in Texas to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure.</description>

      <title>On Speakers and Tokens</title>
      <link>https://morethanmen.org/posts/00467_on-speakers-and-tokens/</link>

      <description>One of the most often cited ways to encourage diversity within our communities is to promote diversity amongst the speakers we feature at our events. There has been a lot of high-profile success in this - TAM has been approaching 50/50 gender representation, for instance - but there still seem to be a lot of mostly-white, mostly-male speaker rosters and panels. One way that has been proposed for speakers to take action is for white men to decline an invitation to speak at an event or on a panel that lacks diversity.</description>

      <description>Want to thank the people at More Than Men for having me. To start, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share a recent post from my own blog, then I&amp;rsquo;ll get to work on some original content. Enjoy!
You know, I had other things to do. Better things to do. I really, really wanted to stop being a complete asshole and actually answer my email, because I love my friends and I have been an irresponsible ass about that.</description>

      <description>FOGcon is a feminist-friendly literary science fiction convention. And it&amp;rsquo;s happening in my back yard at the end of March. Feminist nerds, unite! The Good Men Project shared our critique of them with their readers. The commentors there when nuts. Sasha is now a hipster lady. And now you can share your awesomely stupid anti-diversity comments on a Tumblr! Shuffling feet: a black man’s view on Schroedinger’s Rapist. A dismantling of a common &amp;ldquo;argument&amp;rdquo; used by the anti-diversity side, written by someone who knows.</description>

      <description>I am also a white male. That&amp;rsquo;s right, I&amp;rsquo;m swinging pale pipe.
This means I have at least two major positions of privilege over many of my compatriots in all of these various fights, and that my privilege causes my words to be amplified while others&#39; meritorious positions are muted. In addition, I am cisgender, where my societally-expected gender comports with the physical sex I was born with; and my heterosexuality is likewise considered &amp;ldquo;the norm&amp;rdquo; in society, and I am therefore privileged by virtue of happening to be part of a majority where the minorities are often silenced, excluded or ignored, whether purposefully or not.</description>

      <description>Despite the annoying pop-over ads, I used to like The Good Men Project. It seemed to be a site for guys, mostly by guys, about not being horrible in the ways society tries to teach us to be. I mean, they had Amanda Marcotte write about MRAs, and that&amp;rsquo;s always good stuff. Then something happened. There&amp;rsquo;s still some good content there, sure, but it&amp;rsquo;s been infected by creepiness. You have articles about how stupid women don&amp;rsquo;t date Nice Guys because they&amp;rsquo;re brainwashed by rom-coms, creepy patriarchal pieces about sex trafficking where &amp;ldquo;your daughter&amp;rdquo; is equated with a drug,&amp;amp; ridiculous straw-man replies to a woman who talks about rape culture, a decidedly mixed bag of whining and actually good stuff under the &amp;ldquo;presumption of guilt&amp;rdquo; tag, and then the infamous piece by a founder about how girls are just different from men and should stop being such nagging bitches.</description>

Oh, I know: hate + apathy.] There&amp;rsquo;s this Women in Secularism conference happening in May. I can&amp;rsquo;t make it, but you should go if you can. Unquestioned Privilege is a great post about rudeness and microaggression over on Skepchick. The skepchicks are also using delicious cookies to fight hate.

      <description>According to some dudes the whole &amp;ldquo;seduction community&amp;rdquo; is actually not, like you might at first think, a bunch of creepy not-technically-rapists - they&amp;rsquo;re really virtuous freedom fighters, saving men and women from the evils of female privilege. You see, men are horribly oppressed when it comes to sex and dating. They need sex so, so bad and stupid women just refuse to give it to them when they ask! It&amp;rsquo;s terribly shocking, I know.</description>

      <description>Noted anti-racist writer (and decidedly white white-guy) Tim Wise has an excellent piece about the myth of &amp;ldquo;reverse racism&amp;rdquo;, and I encourage you toread the whole thing. My favorite paragraph, though, is this one:
 I don&amp;rsquo;t care about reverse racism, jokes at the expense of the straight, the male, and the able-bodied because right now, in our world it has no power. None. It might make some guy feel bad for a minute, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t contribute to a vile systemic problem the same way that attacks and slurs against women and minorities do.</description>

      <description>Like many people I was raised in a milieu with more than the usual amount of sexism and racism. I often say &amp;ldquo;I got better&amp;rdquo;, but the truth is, I&amp;rsquo;m getting better. I strive to learn more every day. To be empathic and listen to the experiences of people who are different with me. I work to be a better, more accepting and less horrible person. I&amp;rsquo;m an able-bodied, cisgendered, straight, white man.</description>

      <description>‘Diversity’ is one of those words that people can get tired of hearing very quickly: it makes them feel guilty and insensitive, and it almost always raises acrimonious discussion until it fizzles out, leaving bitter emotions in its wake. &amp;amp; A quick perusal of comment threads (such as here, here, and here) might lead one to think that there is a small number of privileged minorities who have nothing better to do then to complain, insult, and derail conversations towards their pet project: complaining about a problem that was solved years ago.</description>

      <description>[Sasha here. One of the main points of More Than Men is to get regular guys talking about why diversity matters to them. Here&amp;rsquo;s our first guest post making that happen.]
In the recent past our society has been making incremental steps towards the universal acceptance of diversity and the equality of all flavours of humanity, whether it be gender, race, sexuality, blood type or the amount of hair on your knees.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s come to our attention that there are some people who are a little confused by what the More Than Men project is all about. Perhaps because our original About was not as clear as it should have been, perhaps because a group of white guys gathering together for something that&amp;rsquo;s not horrible is such a novel concept, but somehow there are people who either have the wrong idea about us or who are skeptical about what we will actually be doing.</description>

      <description>Greta Christina has written about the &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;hellip;&amp;quot; problem many of my fellow dudes have when listening to women talk about sexism and misogyny. I want to talk about a specific &amp;ldquo;Yes, but&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; here: &amp;ldquo;Y_es, but that&amp;rsquo;s not sexist because he/I/they don&amp;rsquo;t hate all women, just that one!_&amp;rdquo; The argument is that since the person slinging gendered slurs doesn&amp;rsquo;t hate women as a class, they aren&amp;rsquo;t a misogynist, therefore they&amp;rsquo;re just a jerk and we we can shut up about this problem and go talk about how dumb Christians are again.</description>

      <description>We live in a diverse world and I think we can all agree that any time a group’s makeup is less diverse than the world at large there are reasons for it. Here in the United States we have more diversity than most places, but when attending nerd events, atheist events, and skeptic events I keep finding myself in the majority. Why is that? I believe it is because something about those groups is making women and racial and sexual minorities feel like the group is Not For Them or are experiencing things that make them feel uncomfortable and unwelcome.</description>
