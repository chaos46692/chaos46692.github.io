      Something that Natalie Reed touched on, is the fact that straight, white, cis men are seen as the “default“. This cultural message leads some male skeptics, who should really know better, to have internalized an idea that minorities have biases (because, obviously, they’re different!) and they do not. I think this is the biggest factor leading to what’s come to be called “mansplaining“. (When you think about it, “mansplaining” is not much different from what many skeptics and atheists do all the time when talk to theists, climate change deniers, creationists, anti-vaxers, etc.

This post is not going to be another discussion of Loftus or his remarks. There’s not really any need to carry that any further, I feel comfortable with how this resolved and like there isn’t much left to be said.

      I despair and come close to just saying &ldquo;fuck it&rdquo; and abandoning my participation in the skeptic and atheist communities on at least a weekly basis because of how often I see unconscionable behavior not only happen but being defended by man, and in some cases at least tolerated by very prominent leaders in our community. Sam Harris has famously argued that &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;, liberal theists provide cover for religious extremists. I see the same thing happening here.

      From the start there has been a lot of internal and external discussion of whether or not a project like More Than Men with it&rsquo;s country-club style membership can really serve a purpose in the movement for greater equality and diversity. Obviously I think it can, if only because there are some people who are receptive to the message but because of how society trains them they have a harder time hearing and understanding a minority voice.

      Not only will I be attending (though not speaking), but we&rsquo;ve managed to get an even split between male and female speakers including our parent organization&rsquo;s president, Elyse Anders of the Women Thinking Free Foundation.
Tickets until April 1st are $50 ($35 for students) and $60 for everyone thereafter so, get your tickets soon and save yourself some money for the bar!

      That’s just not true. I’m going to admit something right now. I’m a straight, white guy with a middle-class upbringing. I am also, irrevocably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and probably a host of other -ists and -phobics that you can toss at me. I’m like this because I’m a product of a society that is also racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and all the others. I’ve been taught a certain view of normalcy, and as a result, I act with mannerisms that reflect this certain view.

      Something lighter today. My good friend and my favorite comedian Matt Gubser gives his take on the questions I asked on Friday. This is him working on his bit before it&rsquo;s completely finished, so he&rsquo;s asked that you not judge him by it. I think it&rsquo;s hilarious, though.(Video is NSFW due to some salty language.)

      Don&rsquo;t worry about having something &ldquo;original&rdquo; to say (lord knows I&rsquo;m not very original), or for it being super-duper polished (you&rsquo;ve read my work, right), just write a few hundred words, make a video, draw a picture&hellip;and send it to me!

      Bullshit.
First off, we all have stories about that atheist who is not a critical thinker. My own is a guy who laughed at Christianity because their sole evidence was a book that is a few thousand years old. In the next breath he sang the praises of traditional Chinese magical ground-up penisherbal medicine, because it&rsquo;s been practiced for thousands of years. In other words what was laughable as evidence for Christianity was compelling evidence for something that appealed to him.
