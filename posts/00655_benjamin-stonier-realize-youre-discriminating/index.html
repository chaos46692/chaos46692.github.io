<p>That’s just not true. I’m going to admit something right now. I’m a straight, white guy with a middle-class upbringing. I am also, irrevocably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and probably a host of other -ists and -phobics that you can toss at me. I’m like this because I’m a product of a society that is also racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and all the others. I’ve been taught a certain view of normalcy, and as a result, I act with mannerisms that reflect this certain view. It’s not an attempt to insult; I’m not consciously discriminatory. But it’s still there.</p>
<p>It used to be that whenever I heard that my behaviour was inappropriate, I brushed it off. <em>I’m an ally</em>, I’d think. <em>I’m the sort of guy who stands out there when there’s <strong>real</strong> racism/sexism et. al going on. Why are they bothering me about a couple words?!</em> What I’d lost track of was the fact that I don’t get to determine what &ldquo;real&rdquo; homophobia/ableism et. al is. I don’t have that ability. I was making a privileged assumption that I can see these things from the outside, define them, and live in a world where I’ve made a nice little line in the sand, labelled it racism, and then skirt with it as I see fit. I forgot to seek the approval of those who’d be impacted by my assertions to affirm they are true. I’d forgotten what being a skeptic means - asking questions and challenging my perceptions to find the truth.</p>
<p>I got to this point, and once I read some pretty powerful writings on the subject by a blogger who I am proud to consider a friend, I realized that I was still doing it wrong. Yes, I can still share in &ldquo;off colour&rdquo; joking with my friends, from time to time, because my friends and I consent with each other that we will poke fun at our various differences. We have consented to being less than politically correct together. But when we&rsquo;re not in that consented environment, I have encouraged them to watch their behaviour. It&rsquo;s as simple as using different words, or asking why you act in a certain way. Why did I lock my door when that Native-Canadian walked by? I didn&rsquo;t even notice I was doing it until it was done. Why did I call that &ldquo;queer&rdquo;? Why did I say that Prime Minister Harper&rsquo;s newest law was &ldquo;retarded&rdquo;? There&rsquo;s reasons why. Because I&rsquo;ve been taught certain stereotypes, because I&rsquo;ve heard other people use the word, and because I wanted to express how something was stupid but I used a word that has nothing to do with stupid. I can challenge these assumptions as wrong, as made acceptable only because I am a product of a world where these assumptions and stereotypes are still subconsciously acceptable.</p>
<p>I can’t tell you what you’re doing wrong, other white privileged guys, but I can tell you who can. Look up some awesome bloggers like <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/blaghag/">Jen McCreight</a>, <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta">Greta Christina</a>, the <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/crommunist">Crommunist</a>, and <a href="http://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed">Natalie Reed</a> (oh look to your left, I think most of ‘em are over there!). As members of these groups, they are qualified to let you know what’s right and what’s wrong. The most important thing I can tell you is that you’re probably fucking this up somewhere. You’re probably acting in a way that screws with diversity without even knowing it. And if your response to reading that is “But&hellip;I’m an ally!” or “But&hellip;I have a gay/black/trans/female/mentally disabled/otherwise minority friend!”, then you need to step back and take off your skeptic/humanist label. You need to recognize that you’re not questioning your own assertions until you ascertain with proof that it’s true.
