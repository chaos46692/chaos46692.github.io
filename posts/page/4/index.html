      Want to thank the people at More Than Men for having me. To start, I&rsquo;d like to share a recent post from my own blog, then I&rsquo;ll get to work on some original content. Enjoy!
You know, I had other things to do. Better things to do. I really, really wanted to stop being a complete asshole and actually answer my email, because I love my friends and I have been an irresponsible ass about that.

      FOGcon is a feminist-friendly literary science fiction convention. And it&rsquo;s happening in my back yard at the end of March. Feminist nerds, unite! The Good Men Project shared our critique of them with their readers. The commentors there when nuts. Sasha is now a hipster lady. And now you can share your awesomely stupid anti-diversity comments on a Tumblr! Shuffling feet: a black man’s view on Schroedinger’s Rapist. A dismantling of a common &ldquo;argument&rdquo; used by the anti-diversity side, written by someone who knows.

      Greg Laden has enlisted several people in making a series of three videos for the project. Many thanks to Greg and all his friends (credits in the final chapter). Here&rsquo;s part one. Part two will be posted tomorrow, and part three on Friday. (Greg took it upon himself to organize this video, the people you see are Sheril Kirshenbaum, Desiree Schell, and Jafsica.)

      I am also a white male. That&rsquo;s right, I&rsquo;m swinging pale pipe.
This means I have at least two major positions of privilege over many of my compatriots in all of these various fights, and that my privilege causes my words to be amplified while others' meritorious positions are muted. In addition, I am cisgender, where my societally-expected gender comports with the physical sex I was born with; and my heterosexuality is likewise considered &ldquo;the norm&rdquo; in society, and I am therefore privileged by virtue of happening to be part of a majority where the minorities are often silenced, excluded or ignored, whether purposefully or not.

      Despite the annoying pop-over ads, I used to like The Good Men Project. It seemed to be a site for guys, mostly by guys, about not being horrible in the ways society tries to teach us to be. I mean, they had Amanda Marcotte write about MRAs, and that&rsquo;s always good stuff. Then something happened. There&rsquo;s still some good content there, sure, but it&rsquo;s been infected by creepiness. You have articles about how stupid women don&rsquo;t date Nice Guys because they&rsquo;re brainwashed by rom-coms, creepy patriarchal pieces about sex trafficking where &ldquo;your daughter&rdquo; is equated with a drug,&amp; ridiculous straw-man replies to a woman who talks about rape culture, a decidedly mixed bag of whining and actually good stuff under the &ldquo;presumption of guilt&rdquo; tag, and then the infamous piece by a founder about how girls are just different from men and should stop being such nagging bitches.

      [Looks like Canada &ldquo;fixed&rdquo; it, but why can something like this even happen? Oh, I know: hate + apathy.] There&rsquo;s this Women in Secularism conference happening in May. I can&rsquo;t make it, but you should go if you can. Unquestioned Privilege is a great post about rudeness and microaggression over on Skepchick. The skepchicks are also using delicious cookies to fight hate. And if you&rsquo;re a vegan, I have some good news for you.

      According to some dudes the whole &ldquo;seduction community&rdquo; is actually not, like you might at first think, a bunch of creepy not-technically-rapists - they&rsquo;re really virtuous freedom fighters, saving men and women from the evils of female privilege. You see, men are horribly oppressed when it comes to sex and dating. They need sex so, so bad and stupid women just refuse to give it to them when they ask! It&rsquo;s terribly shocking, I know.

      Noted anti-racist writer (and decidedly white white-guy) Tim Wise has an excellent piece about the myth of &ldquo;reverse racism&rdquo;, and I encourage you toread the whole thing. My favorite paragraph, though, is this one:
 I don&rsquo;t care about reverse racism, jokes at the expense of the straight, the male, and the able-bodied because right now, in our world it has no power. None. It might make some guy feel bad for a minute, but it doesn&rsquo;t contribute to a vile systemic problem the same way that attacks and slurs against women and minorities do.
