<p>More than men has been inactive for a very long time. Unfortunately, due to neglect the WordPress site got hacked and the site was in general disarray. 
I wanted to preserve the site, while minimzing the amount of maintanance it took long-term. To that end, I have converted the original to a <a href="https://gohugo.io/">static site</a>
which is more stable, but unfortunately does not include some of the original content like comments and images that were hotlinked (<a href="https://www.pixsy.com/academy/image-owner/hotlinking/">don&rsquo;t hotlink kids!</a>).</p>
<p>The More Than Men project is a campaign by the Women Thinking Free Foundation, a science and critical thinking outreach program focused on women and women’s issues. With a board of directors that is half men, we realize that white men are in a unique position to provide advocacy for underrepresented groups in almost every field. Men are not the problem, the problem is privilege, and we need to work together to make diversity happen.</p>
<p>More Than Men is a social media project for men to stand up together to take an active role in diversity advocacy, educating people about what diversity outreach is and is not, and dispelling myths about what it means to actively pursue a more inclusive community. This is a chance for men to have a conversation about why diversity matters to them, and how they can benefit, and what they can do to help.</p>
<p>More Than Men is not about apologizing for being male but it is also not about claiming we know better than people what their experiences in the world are like. It is about admitting and embracing who you are, and using that to help build a better community.</p>

          Something that Natalie Reed touched on, is the fact that straight, white, cis men are seen as the “default“. This cultural message leads some male skeptics, who should really know better, to have internalized an idea that minorities have biases (because, obviously, they’re different!) and they do not. I think this is the biggest factor leading to what’s come to be called “mansplaining“. (When you think about it, “mansplaining” is not much different from what many skeptics and atheists do all the time when talk to theists, climate change deniers, creationists, anti-vaxers, etc.

This post is not going to be another discussion of Loftus or his remarks. There’s not really any need to carry that any further, I feel comfortable with how this resolved and like there isn’t much left to be said.

          I despair and come close to just saying &ldquo;fuck it&rdquo; and abandoning my participation in the skeptic and atheist communities on at least a weekly basis because of how often I see unconscionable behavior not only happen but being defended by man, and in some cases at least tolerated by very prominent leaders in our community. Sam Harris has famously argued that &ldquo;moderate&rdquo;, liberal theists provide cover for religious extremists. I see the same thing happening here.

          From the start there has been a lot of internal and external discussion of whether or not a project like More Than Men with it&rsquo;s country-club style membership can really serve a purpose in the movement for greater equality and diversity. Obviously I think it can, if only because there are some people who are receptive to the message but because of how society trains them they have a harder time hearing and understanding a minority voice.

          That’s just not true. I’m going to admit something right now. I’m a straight, white guy with a middle-class upbringing. I am also, irrevocably racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and probably a host of other -ists and -phobics that you can toss at me. I’m like this because I’m a product of a society that is also racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, and all the others. I’ve been taught a certain view of normalcy, and as a result, I act with mannerisms that reflect this certain view.

          Bullshit.
First off, we all have stories about that atheist who is not a critical thinker. My own is a guy who laughed at Christianity because their sole evidence was a book that is a few thousand years old. In the next breath he sang the praises of traditional Chinese magical ground-up penisherbal medicine, because it&rsquo;s been practiced for thousands of years. In other words what was laughable as evidence for Christianity was compelling evidence for something that appealed to him.

Is there a difference between calling a man a whore and calling a woman a whore? Please explain why you think so.
Are women responsible for the sexual behavior of men around them if they dress a certain way? Where does that line get drawn? What does that say about men and their agency as humans?

          Here&rsquo;s the thing: unless you start being an asshole I&rsquo;m not trying to make you feel like a crappy person. We&rsquo;re all forced into this system and we have to reason our way out of it. Just like many of us reject the &ldquo;common sense&rdquo; arguments for religious belief and then we ask questions and gather information and draw a conclusion. Your average theist isn&rsquo;t stupid or evil, they just haven&rsquo;t done the work or had that &ldquo;deconversion&rdquo; moment.
